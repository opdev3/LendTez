# LendTez
LendTez is an open-source, Peer-to-Peer lending and borrowing protocol with no commissions and no liquidation where users can participate as borrowers or lenders. Borrowers can borrow XTZ and Tezos-based tokens built with the FA token standards (FA1.2 and FA2), while lenders provide liquidity.
